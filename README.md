# ðŸ§º Basketry

Generate service-oriented code from popular API definition languages.

## Quick Start

The following example converts a "Swagger" doc into Typescript types.

### Install packages

Install the following: `npm install --save-dev basketry @basketry/swagger-2 @basketry/typescript`

### Config

Add `basketry.config.json` to the root of your project:

```json
{
  "parser": "@basketry/swagger-2",
  "generators": ["@basketry/typescript"],
  "source": "src/petstore.json",
  "output": "src"
}
```

Add the following script to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "basketry": "basketry"
}
```

### Generate code

Run the script: `npm run basketry`

When the script is run, basketry will parse the source file (`src/petstore.json`) using the specified parser (`@basketry/swagger-2`) and then run each specified generator (in this case only `@basketry/typescript`) writing the output folder (`src`).

You can also run Basketry in watch mode by passing the `-w` option: `npm run basketry -- -w`. While in watch mode, Basketry will re-run all generators whenever the source file is updated.
