# ðŸ§º Basketry

Generate service-oriented code from popular API definition languages.

## Quick Start

The following example converts a "Swagger" doc into Typescript types:

1. Save `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json` as `petstore.json` in the root of your project.
1. Install packages: `npm install -g basketry @basketry/swagger-2 @basketry/typescript`
1. Generate code: `basketry --source petstore.json --parser @basketry/swagger-2 --generators @basketry/typescript --output src`

When the last step is run, basketry will parse the source file (`petstore.json`) using the specified parser (`@basketry/swagger-2`) and then run each specified generator (in this case only `@basketry/typescript`) writing the output folder (`src`).

## Config file

You can alternatively use a config file rather than having to pass command line arguments.

Add `basketry.config.json` to the root of your project:

```json
{
  "parser": "@basketry/swagger-2",
  "generators": ["@basketry/typescript"],
  "source": "src/petstore.json",
  "output": "src"
}
```

Add the following script to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "basketry": "basketry"
}
```

Now you can generate code by running `npm run basketry`. Note that you can mix and match CLI arguments and config file settingsâ€”CLI arguments will override the config file if the same setting is specified in both places.

## CLI Usage

Code can be generated using the `basketry` command.

### Source file

Use `-s`, `--source` to supply the source file path:

```
basketry --source src/petstore.json
```

Or pipe contents in via stdio:

```
cat src/petstore.json | basketry
```

### Parser

Use `-p`, `--parser` to specify the parser to use:

```
basketry --parser @basketry/swagger-2
```

See the "How does it work?" section below for info on what values can be used as a parser string.

### Generators

Use `-g`, `--generators` to specify one or more generator to use:

```
basketry --generators @basketry/typescript
```

```
basketry --generators @basketry/typescript @basketry/typescript-validators
```

See the "How does it work?" section below for info on what values can be used as a generator string.

### Output directory

Use `-o`, `--output` to specify the path to the output folder. Writes to the current working directory if omitted and config is not found.

```
basketry --output src
```

All generated files will be written to the specified `output` directory. Some generators may write files to a subdirectory within the main output directory. (Note that if multiple generators write a file with the same file name, only one of the files will remain.)

### Config file

Use `-c`, `--config` to specify Path to the config file. (Defaults to `basketry.conifg.json` in the root of your project.)

```
basketry --config some-other-name.json
```

All generated files will be written to the specified `output` directory. Some generators may write files to a subdirectory within the main output directory. (Note that if multiple generators write a file with the same file name, only one of the files will remain.)

### Watch mode

Use `-w`, `--watch` to run in watch mode. In watch mode, `--source` must be specified (you can't pipe to stdio). Running in watch mode will immediately generate output file and then update the output file on each subsequent change to the source SDL file.

```
generate-server-types --input schema.graphql --output types.g.ts --watch
```

You can also run Basketry in watch mode by passing the `-w` option: `npm run basketry -- -w`. While in watch mode, Basketry will re-run all generators whenever the source file is updated.

## How does it work?

Internally, basketry is a plugable pipeline that translates a service from a Service Definition Language (SDL) to one or more programatic or human readable langugages. The first step is to use a Parser to convert and SDL in an Intermediate Representation (IR) of the service. In the second step, this IR is passed to one or more Generators which convert the IR into the final target language.

Basketry coordinates the pipeline and writes the resulting output to the file system. It also exposes an lightweight set of types and tools to build custom Parsers and Generators. By decoupling the SDL parsing and code generating steps, Parsers and Generators can be easily mixed and matched.

### Parser

A "Parser" is a JavaScript module whose default export is a parsing function that converts in input SDL into the intermediate representation of a Service:

```ts
type Parser = (input: string) => Service;

const parser: Parser = (input) => {
  // Parser implementation goes here
};

export default parser;
```

### Generators

A "Generator" is a JavaScript module whose default export is a generator function that converts in input intermediate representation of the service into one or more files:

```ts
type Generator = (service: Service) => File[];

const generator: Generator = (service) => {
  // Generator implementation goes here
};

export default generator;
```

### Using parsers and generators

Any string that can be used to "require" a CommonJS module can be used to specify a parser or generator.

For example, any parser (as described above) that can be required with `const myParser = require('./path/to/my/parser')` can be used with Basketry with `basketry --parser ./path/to/my/parser`. This applies to both modules defined within your project and packages installed from NPM. If it can be required from within your project, it can be used as a Parser or Generator.

Although Basketry is written in the JavaScript family of languages, it can be used to generate code in any language.

## For contributors:

### Run this project

1.  Install packages: `npm ci`
1.  Build the code: `npm run build`
1.  Run it! `npm start`

Note that the `lint` script is run prior to `build`. Auto-fixable linting or formatting errors may be fixed by running `npm run fix`.

### Create and run tests

1.  Add tests by creating files with the `.test.ts` suffix
1.  Run the tests: `npm t`
1.  Test coverage can be viewed at `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

### Publish a new package version

1. Ensure latest code is published on the `main` branch.
1. Create the new version number with `npm version {major|minor|patch}`
1. Push the branch and the version tag: `git push origin main --follow-tags`

The [publish workflow](https://github.com/basketry/basketry/actions/workflows/publish.yml) will build and pack the new version then push the package to NPM. Note that publishing requires write access to the `main` branch.
